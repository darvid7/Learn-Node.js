- minimalistic open source web framework for Node.js, really popular
- used to build web applications and APIs
- uses MVC concepts

$ npm init					 // generate package.json
$ npm install express --save // saves it to package.json or can add
								it to the file (dependencies) then use $ npm install

run using $ node app        // file name
In package.json {} is a new object so
"dependicies":{
	"express":"ver_no"		 // "*" for most up to date
}

Cannot GET / menas we have not set the route yet

-- Middleware --
has access to the request and response object and the next piece of middleware that will fire after

nodemon - so you don't need to restart server after changes
npm install nodemon -g
now instead of $ node app use $ nodemon

-- Working with template engines--
EJS - embedded JavaScript, client side templating language
- standard HTML with variable includes
can use Jade as well

don't want to repeat code for every single view --> create partials
now we have a set header and footer we can reuse for each page via
<% include partials/header %>

-- Validation, express validator --
can find middleware set up on github https://github.com/ctavan/express-validator
just need to copy it into our middleware section

-- brining Mongo DB into applicaiton --
mongoose is really popular
but using a simple one mongo.js for this example

The POST request method is designed to request that a web server accepts the data enclosed in the request message's
body for storage. It is often used when uploading a file or submitting a completed web form.
In contrast, the HTTP GET request method is designed to retrieve information from the server.

GET - from server
POST (man) - take my data

for delete request - do through ajax
