Jade is the default HTML engine/helper for Express
uses slightly different syntax

it is being includied in block content (needs to be used in sub view files as well)

layout.jade
doctype html
html
  head
    title= title
    link(rel='stylesheet', href='/stylesheets/style.css')
  body
    block content // here references bit in subview


error.jade
extends layout    // which is here

block content
  h1= message
  h2= error.status
  pre #{error.stack}


note: content on home page is coming from the index view

html to jade
http://html2jade.org/

extends layout

block content
  h1= title // title passed through, called Express from index.js note: }  #{} for concatenation
  p Welcome to #{title}
  // need #{title} when contactinate, however if no other data i.e. h1= title then can do without

note: need to restart server when edit js to show it
